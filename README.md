# ðŸ§ª TestTask Project

## ðŸ“œ About This Project

Welcome to the **TestTask** repository! This project is designed to demonstrate the creation of automated tests for a **payment processing API**. The primary aim is to ensure that the payment flow works as expected, both from the **backend** (API testing) and **frontend** (UI testing).

### Key Features:
- **API Testing**: Validates API endpoints for payment creation, order status, and payment processing.
- **UI Testing**: Simulates user interactions for the payment process (e.g., entering payment details, confirming transactions).
- **Test Framework**: Uses **JUnit** for test execution and **Selenide** for UI interactions.
- **Assertions**: Built with **AssertJ** to keep tests simple, readable, and maintainable.
